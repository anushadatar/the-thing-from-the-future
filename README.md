# The Thing From The Future
This webpage generates scenarios from [the thing from the future](http://situationlab.org/project/the-thing-from-the-future/), 
a game from Situation Lab. This was adapted by the print-and-play edition, though this version does not include the collective
prompt generation component at this time. The scenarios generate on this [GitHub pages site](https://anushadatar.github.io/the-thing-from-the-future/).

## Future Work
I created this as a quick prototype to engage in the imaginitive storytelling component of this game while communicating with
friends over a video call. Future work would incorporate actually collectively generating the storytelling component,
actually storing the individual stories within the site, and providing a way to share stories and drawings directly on the site. There
also could be some improvements associated with the overall website style and user experience.
